    <h1>memories with my beloved mother</h1>
    <h3>why did you leave us so soon?</h3>
    <p>i had a lot of affection to my mom, when i heard of her demise, i was dumbfounded. why would God take her that faster? i wonder. I had prayed to him, pleaded him not to take her life away- since she is all i got. But I was wrong! He does things according to what he deems fit, not knowing the pain others will be left with.</p>
<strong>mom we never celebrated your 50th birthday</strong>
    <h2>i have lots of memories as follows:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>pre-primary level</li>
            <li>primary level</li>
            <li>high school level</li>
            <li>tertiary level</li>
            <li>at home</li>
    </ol>
<em>but why did you leave me and we had promised each other to wait until i finished my campus education, secure a job, then make you live like a queen? i had good news to share with you but.....</em>
<hr>
<h3>pre-primary memories</h3>
<ul>
    <li>i liked school, and you were happy for me, i requested to join as soon as i turned five</li>
    <li>you told me that i had relieved you a burden for you used to carry me to work- picking tea</li>
    <li>i never let you down, since i would cry that i want to accompany my sibblings to school(they used to go to school at 6:00am)- i saved you time  for arriving at the workplace. <strong>i never ever liked your job. i used to wish that i would grow up faster and make you stop plucking tea--but you disappointed me!!</strong></li>
    <li>sometimes my bro and i would be reluctant to go to school-a behaviour i never knew where i had developed it from. you would give us a push, with beatings up to pyrethrum</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>primary school..</h3>
<dl>
    <dd><h4>you being away from us for a couple of years</h4></dd>
    <dt>you conflicted with dad when i was in class one. You parted ways, and i lived with dad up to when i was in class four, heading five- when francis was getting circumcised. But i always felt your presence <em>even from now henceforth i believe you will never leave me... not even for a second.</em></dt>
    <dd><h4>being the best in class</h4></dd>
    <dt>you were happy for me when i would defeat others in the school examnations. not once or twice did you come for prize-giving ceremonies, and you would proudly step forward to accompany me when receiving my gift,,i was ever in the top of the list.</dt>
    <dd><h4>somehow being notorious</h4></dd>
    <dt>There was a time when i was in grade four, you were called by my class teacher, madam Esther, because i had abused other pupils- by beating them. But to my amazement, you never punished me, that made me regret and i stopped that habit</dt>

<h3>High school life</h3>
<ul>
    <li>on 1st January 2019, you broke the news to me that you never had enough money to take me to a boarding school. You pleaded me to go to Mukuyu on condition that i would never get returned home due to school fees</li>
    <li>i never let you down, and worked hard, i remember when i scored a 99% in history test! you were extremely happy and congratulated me. Unfortunately i scored a C+ in KCSE which was a great shock to me. You mourned with me-thank you</li>
    <li>When i told you that i wanted to repeat, since i was not satisfied with that grade, you never turned me down. You took a loan and paid fees and exam in Bathi High, and responded on time when i called due to a problem</li>
    <li>How happy i was when you came on prayers day!!- i never told you. I felt special</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3>campus life..</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>i never had an opportunity to share with you the campus experience</strong></li>
    <li>eventhough you had insufficient money, i insisted on reporting, if bad bad,, you send me to the posho mill to mill my maize into maize flour</li>
    <li>in the morning you gave me a hundred bob as pocket money...i said nothing since i knew your situation</li>
    <li>also in that morning i was leaving, you woke up irregardless of you feeling unwell. you went to the shamba and packed for me sukuma, of which i ate for three days.</li>
    <li><em>i longed to narrate to you the tiring registration process. When i calle you requestin for 500 shillings for x-ray medical report, i knew you had no money, but i believed yow would get me. you sent David and after some minutesm i was attended to.</em></li>
    <li>in that same afternoon, i called you and told you that the university had declined admitting me without paying a little fees. i knew i was stressing you out but i had no otherwise</li>
    <li>you spoke to Njoki, who sent me 2400, which i paid and got admitted</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>At home</h3>
<p>You used to tell me that sometimes i talked too much,, but i always wanted to break the boredom and make you smile. <em>tou told me that when i was an infant, i talked first, before i could even walk. You told me that you used to be happy since we would converse eventhough i was little!</em></p>
<p>mom you only punished me once. You were very cool. But that was your strength since i never wanted to wrong you.</p>
<p>sometimes i would get so moody and you never talked to me at that moment. You always waited for me to cool down my tempers</p>
